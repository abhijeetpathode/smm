Hereâ€™s a brief summary for each concept:

1. Inline Functions: Functions marked as inline are expanded directly at the call location, reducing call overhead for small functions.


2. Call by Value: Passes a copy of the variable, leaving the original variable unchanged.


3. Call by Reference: Passes a reference, allowing the function to modify the original variable.


4. Class Student/Employee and Print Details: Classes with members (like name, ID) and functions to display information, demonstrating encapsulation.


5. Local Variable: Defined within a function or block, only accessible within that scope.


6. Global Variable: Defined outside functions, accessible throughout the program.


7. Menu-Driven Program (Switch Case): User selects operations (e.g., arithmetic) using a switch statement.


8. Default Constructor: No-argument constructor, initializing objects with default values.


9. Parameterized Constructor: Constructor with parameters for specific initial values.


10. Copy Constructor: Initializes an object as a copy of another, useful for deep copying.


11. "this" Keyword with Friend Class: this points to the current object; friend classes have special access to private/protected members.


12. Multiple Inheritance: A class inherits from multiple base classes, inheriting behaviors from multiple sources.
